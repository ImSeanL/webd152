    <p>I am a big fan of soda. I'm always trying new flavors when they come out. However, I'm also the only person I know that actually likes generic soda. Why spend more? In general, I've found that Kroger makes the best generic soda that we can find here locally in San Diego. My current go to is their Big K zero sugar cherry cola. Personally, I detest the transition from diet to zero sugar that came about in recent years, but this one is pretty good. The zero sugar cola version is also quite good, but their Dr Pepper zero knock off is undrinkable, so avoid at all costs. </p>
