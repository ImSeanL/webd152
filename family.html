            <p>
              Pacific Trails Resort is home to over 5 miles of secluded hiking
              trails, beaches, and forests. Guests can enjoy ocean kayaking,
              guided or solo hiking, walking on the beaches, and participating
              in our world-class birdwatching. Pacific Trails Resort sports an
              extremely high amount of biodiversity so even if birds aren&apos;t
              your thing, there will be plenty of interesting plants and animals
              to look at!

            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              Pacific Trails Resort was originally established as an outpost for
              wilderness monitoring and research. The decision to open access to
              the public comes from our deeply ingrained philosophy that humans
              should have access to all of nature&apos;s splendors. In addition,
              we have another priority &mdash; preservation. We ask that all
              visitors respect these lands as if it were a national preserve. If
              you feel up to it during your stay, please join us for a weekly
              wilderness cleanup for a chance to win prizes!
